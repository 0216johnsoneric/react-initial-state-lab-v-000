# React Initial State Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice setting initial state in a React component
2. Explain the difference between state and props in React

## Overview

The main purpose of this lab is to start introducing students to the difference
between state and props. We can have them set both props and state, but the
semantics of what goes where should be relatively clear.

Things like toggles, ephemeral data, etc. can go in state. (Is it too early for
controlled components?) Everything else should probably be in props.
